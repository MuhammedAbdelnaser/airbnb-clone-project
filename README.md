## Feature Breakdown

### User Management

Complete user registration, authentication, and profile management system. Users can create accounts, verify email addresses, update personal information, and manage their preferences. This feature ensures secure access control and personalized user experiences throughout the platform.

### Property Management

Comprehensive property listing and management capabilities for hosts. Users can add new properties, upload photos, set pricing, manage availability calendars, and update property details. This feature enables property owners to effectively showcase and manage their rental listings.

### Booking System

Advanced reservation management that handles property searches, availability checking, booking creation, and modification. Users can search for properties based on location, dates, and preferences, make reservations, and manage their upcoming trips. The system ensures accurate availability tracking and prevents double bookings.

### Review and Rating System

User feedback mechanism that allows guests to rate and review properties after their stay. This feature builds trust in the platform by providing authentic user experiences and helps future guests make informed decisions. It also provides valuable feedback to property hosts.

### Payment Integration

Secure payment processing system that handles financial transactions between guests and hosts. Supports multiple payment methods, processes refunds, manages security deposits, and ensures PCI compliance. This feature enables seamless and secure monetary transactions.

### Search and Filtering

Powerful search functionality that allows users to find properties based on various criteria such as location, price range, amenities, property type, and availability. Advanced filtering options help users quickly find accommodations that match their specific needs and preferences.

## API Security

### Authentication

Implementation of JWT-based authentication ensures that only verified users can access protected resources. Multi-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security for user accounts. Session management prevents unauthorized access and protects against session hijacking attacks.

### Authorization

Role-based access control (RBAC) ensures users can only access resources they're permitted to use. Proper authorization prevents unauthorized data modification and protects sensitive user information. Different permission levels for guests, hosts, and administrators maintain system integrity.

### Rate Limiting

API rate limiting prevents abuse and ensures fair usage across all users. It protects against DDoS attacks, prevents API abuse, and maintains system performance. Different rate limits for different endpoints ensure critical functionalities remain available even under high load.

### Data Encryption

All sensitive data is encrypted both in transit (HTTPS/TLS) and at rest. Payment information, personal data, and authentication credentials are protected using industry-standard encryption methods. This ensures user privacy and compliance with data protection regulations.

### Input Validation

Comprehensive input validation and sanitization prevent injection attacks, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other malicious inputs. All user inputs are validated against expected formats and constraints before processing, ensuring data integrity and system security.

## CI/CD Pipeline

### What is CI/CD?

Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) is a software development practice that automates the integration, testing, and deployment of code changes. It enables teams to deliver software updates more frequently, reliably, and with fewer bugs by automating repetitive tasks and ensuring consistent quality standards.

### Importance for the Project

CI/CD pipelines are crucial for maintaining code quality, reducing deployment risks, and enabling rapid feature delivery. They provide automated testing, ensure code consistency across team members, enable quick rollbacks if issues arise, and maintain deployment reliability. This approach supports agile development and helps deliver value to users more efficiently.

### Tools and Implementation

**GitHub Actions**: Automated workflows for testing, building, and deployment triggered by code commits and pull requests. Provides seamless integration with the GitHub repository and supports custom workflow configurations.

**Docker**: Containerization ensures consistent environments across development, testing, and production. Docker images provide reproducible builds and simplified deployment processes.

**Jest/Pytest**: Automated testing frameworks for both frontend and backend code ensure code quality and catch bugs early in the development process.

**ESLint/Black**: Code linting and formatting tools maintain code consistency and quality standards across the team.

**Heroku/AWS**: Cloud deployment platforms provide scalable hosting solutions with automated deployment capabilities and easy environment management.
